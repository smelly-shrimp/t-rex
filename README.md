# t-rex
You can use it for minecraft textures. Predefined templates can be found in `/assets`.

Usage:  
e.g.: `t-rex --help`

args:
- `chunk` - chunk size
- `csv` - path to csv file
- `asset` - path to asset (from which you will create sub-assets)
- `dir` - path (directory) to which t-rex will save all sub-assets

To work with it just download the asset from `/assets` and corresponding `csv` file. You can create your textures replacing assets and running t-rex. It will create directory with entered name.
